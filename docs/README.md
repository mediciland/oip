# OIPd Documentation

OIPd currently uses Swagger to document its API endpoints, it is run online on GitHub Pages (the URL is at the top of this repository), and can also be run locally.

## Running Locally

To run the documentation locally, you can either self-host the `index.html` file using the basic NPM `serve` module, or a micro-webserver of your choice.

Step 1. Make sure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed

Step 2. Run the `./runDocs.sh` file to start the docs webserver
